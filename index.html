        <h1> My favorite animal is a penguin!</h1>
        <p> Penguins (order Sphenisciformes, family Spheniscidae) are a group of aquatic flightless birds. They live
            almost exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere, with only one species, the Galápagos penguin, found north of
            the equator. Highly adapted for life in the water, penguins have countershaded dark and white plumage and
            flippers for swimming. Most penguins feed on krill, fish, squid and other forms of sea life which they catch
            while swimming underwater. They spend roughly half of their lives on land and the other half in the sea.

        <p>
            Although almost all penguin species are native to the Southern Hemisphere, they are not found only in cold
            climates, such as Antarctica. In fact, only a few species of penguin live so far south. Several species are
            found in the temperate zone, but one species, the Galápagos penguin, lives near the equator.
